The content is based on the book 'Search inside yourself'.

## Features

### Navigation

The user is able to navigate on the navigation bar. There are three navigation elements according to the three pages Why, How, Who. Due to responsive design requiremets the behaviour and position of the navigation bar is slightly different.
To keep the complexity low and due to the fact that the menu elements are short, there is no toggle function for the mobile view.

Mobile view: Elements are aligned to the center. No toggle used. The widh of the navigation has a min-width (320px) so that the content is not covered from the navigation once the screen gets to smaller. The content top-margin is fixed (130px).

Tablet view: Logo on the left site, navigation elements on the right site.

Desktop view: Logo on the left site, navigation elements on the right site. However effect is implemented. 

There are three media query breakpoints used: (320px), 768px, 992px
