# Calm down

Welcome to my first project, the calm down website is a landing page for people how are motivated to start meditating. It offers motivation and reasons why to start meditating, a few easy meditation techniques and further links to further sources to intensivfy meditation. The content is based on the book 'Search inside yourself'.

## Features

### Navigation

The user is able to navigate on the navigation bar. There are three navigation elements according to the three pages Why, How, Who. Due to responsive design requiremets the behaviour and position of the navigation bar is slightly different.
To keep the complexity low and due to the fact that the menu elements are short, there is no toggle function for the mobile view.

Mobile view: Elements are aligned to the center. No toggle used. The width of the navigation is so small (~300px) that the content is not covered from the navigation once the screen gets smaller for mobile view. 

Tablet view: Logo on the left site, navigation elements on the right site.

Desktop view: Logo on the left site, navigation elements on the right site. However effect is implemented. 

There are three media query breakpoints used: (320px), 768px, 992px

### The header 
Title and logo are above the navigation. Depending on the media query the header gets bigger. The font-size/size of title and logo increases. The header's height is around 100px, therefore. there is a margin-top value of 97px on the main element.
