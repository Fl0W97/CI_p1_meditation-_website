          While diving deeper into resources like 'Search Inside Yourself' or other meditation guides
          can provide a richer understanding, let's kickstart your practice with some fundamental
          concepts. The goal is to initiate your journey, establish a mindful routine, and simply
          be present in the moment. Let's dive in and begin this transformative adventure together!"

          <h3>Relaxation and alertness</h3>
          <p>
            The goal is to cultivate a balance between a focused and stable state of mind that remains soothing.
            Achieving
            this effortlessly requires
            practice, which is precisely what we're here to do.

          <p>
            Drawing from Tan's analogy in his book, envision your mind as a pot of water filled with
            sediment, constantly agitated. The result? Cloudy waters. But by ceasing the agitation
            and allowing the pot to settle, the water becomes calm and clear.

          <h3>Practice, practice, practice, ...</h3>
          <p>
            Think of meditation as akin to hitting the gym for your mind. Just as lifting weights
            strengthens your body, meditation trains your mind to enhance its mental faculties.
            Through consistent practice, your mind becomes calmer, more perceptive, and capable
            of sustained focus, among other benefits.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Your sitting position</h3>
          <p>
            don't fret over finding the perfect stance just yet. Choose
            any of the examples provided in the figure that feels comfortable for about 10 minutesâ€”this
            is all you need for now.

              Let us begin by sitting comfortably. Sit in a position that enables you to ne bpth relaxed
              and alert at the same time, whatever that means to you. Or if you prefer, you may sit like
              a majestic mpuntain, whatever that means to you.
              <br>
              Let us now take three slow, deep breaths to inject both energy snd relaxation into our
              practice.
              Now, let us now take three slow, deep breaths to inject both energy and relaxation into
              our practice.
              <br>
              Now let us breathe naturally and bring a very gentle attention to your breath. You can either
              bring attention to the nostrils, thr abdomen, or the entire body of breath, wheather that
              means to you. Become aware of in breath, out breath, snd space in between.
              <br>
              (short pause)
              <br>
              If you like, you can think of this exercise as resting the mind on the breath. You can
              visualize the breath. You can visualize thr breath to be a resting place, or a cushion,
              or a mattress, ad let the mind rest on it, very gently. Just be.
              <br>
              (long pause)
              <br>
              If at any time you feel distracted vy a sensation, thought, or sound, just acknowledge it,
              exoerience it, and very gently let it go. Bring your attention very gently back to the
              breathing.
              <br>
              (long pause)
              <br>
              If you like, let end us this meditation by inviting joyfull inner oeace to arise.
              <br>
              Breathing in, I am calm.
              <br>
              Breathing out, I smile.
              <br>
              This present moment,
              <br>
              Wonderful.

              in front of you, mindfully, and shift your weight to this foot mindfully. take a short pause,
              and do it with the other foot.
              <br>

              liffting" and when moving and planting your foot forward, you may repeat silently to yourself,
              "moving, moving, moving".
