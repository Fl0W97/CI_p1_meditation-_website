          And finally, let's talk about the person behind all this valuable content who's also on a quest for world
          peace. Can you believe it? He's been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize eight times! I've
          never actually crossed paths with him. As a Code Institute student I am just happy managed to uncover a
          fascinating topic for his debut project.

          <h3><img src="assets/images_logo/image_author.PNG" alt="photo of the book author" class="author_image_size"> The
            author of the book 'Search Inside Yourself'</h3>
          <p>
            Certainly! Chade-Meng Tan, often referred to as Meng, is not your typical tech guru. He's like the Zen
            master who found his way into the
            heart of Silicon Valley. Meng started his journey at Google as an engineer but soon became known as Google's
            "Jolly Good Fellow" for his
            quirky and uplifting personality.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            He created the Search Inside Yourself (SIY) program, blending meditation with emotional intelligence
            training. Meng's book "Search Inside
            Yourself" shares his insights in a delightful mix of anecdotes, exercises, and research. Beyond Google, Meng
            travels the world spreading
            joy and compassion, advocating that happiness is a skill we can cultivate. His approach is down-to-earth and
            inclusive, making complex
            concepts feel light and approachable. Meng reminds us that success and happiness are intertwined, and the
            journey inward is just as
            important as the one outward.

            Florian, a recent addition to Code Institute from Germany, is on a quest to enhance his coding prowess.
            While not a meditation expert, he's intrigued by its potential benefits and strives to implement mindfulness
            into his daily routine. With aproactive and open-minded approach, Florian seeks to merge technical learning 
            with personal growth, recognizing that staying calm and strong inside is just as valuable as improving his 
            coding abilities. Best way to contact him is via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-guldner-4a684897/"
