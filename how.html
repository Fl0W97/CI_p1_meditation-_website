          <h3>Relaxation and alertness</h3>
          <p class="space_bottom">
            The goal is to cultivate a balance between a focused and stable state of mind that remains soothing.
            Achieving
            this effortlessly requires
            practice, which is precisely what we're here to do.

            Drawing from Tan's analogy in his book, envision your mind as a pot of water filled with
            sediment, constantly agitated. The result? Cloudy waters. But by ceasing the agitation
            and allowing the pot to settle, the water becomes calm and clear.

          <h3>Hit the gym</h3>
          <p class="space_bottom">
            Think of meditation as akin to hitting the gym for your mind. Just as lifting weights
            strengthens your body, meditation trains your mind to enhance its mental faculties.
            Through consistent practice, your mind becomes calmer, more perceptive, and capable
            of sustained focus, among other benefits.
          </p>
          <h3>Your sitting position</h3>
          <p>
            don't fret over finding the perfect stance just yet. Choose
            any of the examples provided in the figure that feels comfortable for about 10 minutesâ€”this
            is all you need for now.

              visualize the breath. You can visualize thr breath to be a resting place, or a cushion,
              or a mattress, and let the mind rest on it, very gently. Just be.

            <h4>Setting attention</h4>
            <p class="space_bottom">Let us begin by sitting comfortably. Sit in a position that enables
              you to be both relaxed and alert at the same time, whathever that means to you.
            </p>
            <p class="space_bottom">
              Now, let us breathe naturally and bring very gentle attention to the breath. you can

              whathever that means to you. become aware of breath in, out breath, and space in between.
            </p>
            <h4>Scan Body</h4>
            <h5>Head</h5>
            <p class="space_bottom">
              Now bring your attention to the top of your head, ears, and back of your head. Notice
              sensations, or lack of sensations, for 1 minute.
            </p>
            <h5>Face</h5>
            <p class="space_bottom">
              Now move your attention to your face. Your forehead, eyes, cheeks, nose, lips, mouth, and
              inside of your mouth (gums, tongue) for 1 minute.
            </p>
            <h5>Neck and Shoulders</h5>
            <p class="space_bottom">
              Move your attention to your neck, the inside of your throat, and your shoulders for 1 minute.
            </p>
            <h5>Back</h5>
            <p class="space_bottom">
              Move your attention to your lower back, mid back, and upper back for 1 minute. The back carries
              a lot of our load and stores a lot of our tension. So let us give our backs the kind and loving
              attention they deserve.
            </p>
            <h5>Front</h5>
            <p class="space_bottom">
              Move your attention to the chest and stomach for 1 minute. If it is possible for you, try to
              bring attention to your internal organs, whatever that means to you.
            </p>
            <h5>Entire Body at Once</h5>
            <p class="space_bottom">
              And now, bring your attention to your entire body all at once for 1 minute.
            </p>
            <h4>Scan for emotion</h4>
            <p class="space_bottom">
              Did you find any emotion in your body? If there is any, just notice its presence in the body.
              If not, just notice the absence of emotions, and catch one if it arises in the next 2 minute.
            </p>
            <h5>Positive Emotion</h5>
            <p class="space_bottom">
              Let us now try to experience a positive emotion in the body. Bring to mind a memory of a happy,
              joyous event or a time when you were optimal and productive or a time when you felt confident.
              Experience the feeling of positive emotion. Now, bring your attention to your body. What
              does that positive emotion feel like in the body? On the face? Neck, chest, back? How are
              you breathing? Any difference in level of tension? Let us just experience it for 3 minute.
            </p>
            <h4>Returning to Grounding</h4>
            <p class="space_bottom">
              Let us know return to the present. If you find an emotionally charged thought, just let it go.
              Bring your attention to either your body or your breath, whichever your mind finds more stability
              in. And let's just settle the mind there for 2 minute.
            </p>
            <p>(Long pause)</p>
            <p class="space_bottom">
              Thank you for your attention.
